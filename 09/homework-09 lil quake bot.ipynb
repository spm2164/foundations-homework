    "    Be careful that you're doing all of your math with ints or floats instead of strings that look like ints or floats.\n",
    "    When you write your functions, you can pass either the entire dictionary to the function OR just the part you're curious about (e.g., when you're getting the day you could send the whole earthquake dictionary or just what's in the 'time' key.)\n",
    "    Writing empty functions that always return the same thing are a great way to start off. You can start saying every earthquake is shallow and then fill in the actual code later.\n",

    "    depth_to_words will describe the earthquake's depth\n",
    "    magnitude_to_words will describe the earthquake's power\n",

    "    time_in_words should be \"morning\", \"afternoon\", \"evening\" or \"night\"\n",
    "    date_in_words should be \"Monthname day\", e.g. \"June 22\"\n",
    "    Any other functions as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "DEPTH can be determined from the USGS website - http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/seismology/determining_depth.php - it should be either 'shallow', 'intermediate' or 'deep'\n",
    "\n",
    "POWER should be evocative words like like 'easily ignored' or 'huge' or 'very destructive' (feel free to pick your own) - look on Google Image Search for \"richter scale\" to see some possible descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAGNITUDE should be the actual numerical magnitude.\n",

    "DAY should be the day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIME_OF_DAY should be morning, afternoon, evening or night.\n",

    "DATE should be \"Monthname day\", e.g. \"June 22\".\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP: You probably (a.k.a. definitely) need to convert 'time' - which is a string - into a Python datetime object which can do .hour, .day, .strftime(\"%Y %b %d\") and other fun things. Convert it and test the conversion like this:\n",
