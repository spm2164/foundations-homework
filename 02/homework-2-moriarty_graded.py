# TA-COMMENT: Nicely done up Question 6. An alternate solution:

for number in numbers:
	original = number

	if original < 10:
		number = number * 30

		if (original%2) == 0:
			number = number + 6

	elif original > 50:
		number = number - 10

	if original != -10:
		number = number - 1

	print(number)

# TA-COMMENT: Let me know if that all makes sense.
